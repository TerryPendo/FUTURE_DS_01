## 🎯 Project Overview

This project involved building an interactive dashboard from scratch to help business owners and decision-makers understand key sales metrics. The goal was to identify trends, top-performing products, and customer segments to drive strategic decisions.

**Business Questions Answered:**
- What are the best-selling products and categories?
- When do sales peak throughout the year?
- Which customer segments and regions generate the most revenue?
- What is the overall profit margin and average order value?

## 🛠️ Process & Methodology

1.  **Data Acquisition & Understanding:** Sourced the e-commerce sales dataset containing over 500,000 transactions.
2.  **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Processed the raw data in Power Query to handle missing values, standardize formats, and create a clean, analysis-ready dataset.
3.  **Data Modeling:** Established relationships between tables (if applicable) to build a robust data model.
4.  **KPI & Measure Development:** Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures for key metrics like Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Average Order Value (AOV).
5.  **Dashboard Design & Visualization:** Built an intuitive and visually cohesive dashboard in Power BI with various charts and filters for interactive exploration.

## 📈 Key Features of the Dashboard
